## How to run the game

Load the game into your browser by either forking, downloading or opening this project's [GithubPages URL](https://felgamedev.github.io/arcadegame/)

## How to play

Move your character using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Get across the paved walkway and into the water without touching any bugs to score a point. Score **10 points** to win the game!

As the game progresses more bugs will try to block your path! Watch out for those faster enemies.


Touching a bug will reset your character to the bottom row of the game and deduct one of your **lives**. Your remaining lives are indicated in the top right of the game window.

## Game Over
The game ends when you have 10 points, lost all of your lives or played for three minutes in a single game.
